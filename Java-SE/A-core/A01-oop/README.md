### Training: Enum

- Read the first half of this: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html
- Discuss the `pizza` package, and use as future reference
- Optional: read the second half of the documentation


### Exercise: Enum

1. Month.java in `pm_04_enum.month` package
2. Try to solve Month exercise with Enum property, just like the Planet exmaple in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html
3. Card.java in `pm_04_enum.card` package

### Training: Garbage collector

In other languages like C/C++, programmer is responsible for both creation and destruction of objects. Usually programmer neglects destruction of useless objects. Due to this negligence, at certain point, for creation of new objects, sufficient memory may not be available and entire program will terminate abnormally causing **OutOfMemoryErrors**.

With Java we are lucky, because this is done for us automatically by the Garbage Collector. Although this can be done manually as well, like you will see this in the `pm_04_enum.casino` exercise

Read the following article:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/island-of-isolation-in-java/

### Training: UML Modeling

#### Workshop: Webshop Modeling

Work together with your teammates and model a simple webshop with UML.  
The webshop should have a way to save its users and their information. Each user 
should have a shopping cart, which can be filled with products. Users can buy the
items in their shopping cart, which means their cart becomes empty, however, the
order should be saved somewhere, with information about the products.  
Think through what classes you would use, what variables each class should have and
how the classes should connect to each other.

#### Workshop: Webshop Implementation

Implement the web shop model from the previous workshop.

#### Exercise: Casino

- Casino.md in the `pm_04_enum.casino` package (pair programming)
  - model the exercise
  - implement the exercise

### Hands-On: SonarLint Setup

 1. file -> settings -> plugins -> marketplace -> search: sonarlint -> install
 2. restart idea

 2. Rules -> Search and disable:
     - "Track uses of TODO tags"
     - "Standard outputs should not be used â€¦"

### Workshop: Exception Handling

#### General idea of exception handling

If you run an application you can encounter errors or exceptional cases which can crash your program. One of your task 
as a developer is to write the code in a way that can handle these kind of issues. In Java (and in most OOP languages)
we call these issues exceptions.

Object-oriented languages produce an object from the exception. When a method detects a problem, it creates an instance
of an exception class, than throw that instance with the `throw` keyword to signal the error. The exception is not the 
same as the return value that can be returned with the `return` keyword. When en exception is thrown, the execution of 
the current method is interrupted and the control goes back to the caller.  
If the call was surrounded with a `try-catch` block, the exception is caught and a matching `catch` block will be 
executed. If there was no surrounding `try-catch` block in the direct caller, the caller is also interrupted and throws 
the exception to its caller. The process continues upwards in the call stack until one of the callers catches 
the exception.  
If no method catches the exception and it reaches `main()`, the application is terminated and we see the exception and 
the stack trace in the console.

#### What is an exception?

Exceptions are objects, instances of exception classes. There are some exception classes in the class library but it is 
possible to write own exception classes as well. The class of the exception itself describes what kind of problem arose 
but just like regular objects, exceptions can carry further information in their instance variables.  
For example `IllegalArgumentException` indicates that one of the arguments passed to the method are illegal. In case you
want to implement a method to calculate the square root of real (but not complex) numbers you can throw an instance of 
`IllegalArgumentException` if a negative value is passed to the method, since negative numbers do not have real 
square roots.

#### Class hierarchy of exceptions

Just like every class is (either directly or indirectly) a subclass of `Object`, every exceptions are subclasses of 
`Throwable`. It is the common supertype of objects that can be thrown and caught.

`Error` is a subclass of `Throwable`, which indicates an unforeseen events that the application cannot recover
from, such as running out of memory. Consequently, there is really no point in catching errors. Error classes 
conventionally end with the Error suffix, such as `OutOfMemoryError`.

`Exception` is the common superclass of exceptions. Unlike errors, exceptions warrant error handling and should be 
caught. Some of them can be foreseen, such as I/O exceptions when we work with files. There is the `IOException`
class to signal such problems. Exception classes conventionally end with the Exception suffix.  
For instances of Exception, methods that may throw the exception, must declare that after the parameter list with 
the `throws` keyword. 

There is an important subclass of `Exception`, called `RuntimeException`. The difference is that instances of 
`RuntimeException` are not required to be declared after the method's parameter list. Therefore, these exceptions are 
also called *unchecked exceptions*, whereas those that are instances of `Exception` but not `RuntimeException` are
called *checked exceptions*. 

Unchecked exceptions are usually better to use. In most cases, we can assure that we use a specific method in a way 
that it will not throw an exception so adding a `try-catch` block would be unnecessary and would just make the code 
longer and harder to read. In such cases, it is better to design the method in such a way that it signal errors with
 *unchecked exceptions*.
