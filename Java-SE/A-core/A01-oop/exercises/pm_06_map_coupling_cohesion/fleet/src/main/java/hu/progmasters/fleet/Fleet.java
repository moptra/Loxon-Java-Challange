/**
 * We have three interfaces for Vehicle, LandVehicle and SeaVessel.
 *
 * Use these interfaces to implement the following classes:
 *  - Jeep with an additional method soundHorn()
 *  - Hovercraft with two additional methods enterLand() and enterSea()
 *  - Frigate with an additional method fireGun()
 *
 * Create one more interface called Emergency with just one method soundSiren() (it doesn't take any arguments and doesn't return any value).
 *
 * Write a class PoliceCar that implements the Emergency and LandVehicle interfaces and has an addition patrol() method.
 *
 * A Fleet class has an array/collection that holds different vehicles.
