/**
 * Simulate a shopping list handling application.
 * Make a ShoppingList class and use a HashMap to store the products (items) and their quantity. A product (a separate class)
 * has two instance variables, a name and a price.
 *
 * Write some methods in the ShoppingList:
 *
 * - addNewItem(Product product, int numberOfItems) and addItem(String productName, int price, int numberOfItems) which
 *   adds the new product and the quantity to the shopping list
 *
 * - addOneItem(String productName) which increases the quantity of the product by one
 *
 * - calculateTotalPrice() which returns the total price of the whole shopping list
 *
 * - printList() which prints the quantity, the name and the sum price of each item on the list in a separate row,
 *   and the total price of the whole list in the last row
