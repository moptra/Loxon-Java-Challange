/**
 * We have a pm_06.farm that has several types of animals.
 * Every animal shares certain characteristics:
 *  - they have a name
 *  - each makes a sound ("moo", "cluck" or "oink")
 *
 * The Animal interface defines those things required to be an animal on the pm_06.farm.
 *
 * Define new classes for Cow, Chick and Pig that implement the Animal interface.
 *
 * The Farm has a number of animals and it has a makeAnimalsShout() method,
 * that returns the name and sound of all animals living in the pm_06.farm, like this:
 * "Elsie goes moo"
