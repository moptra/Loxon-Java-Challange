## Trainings

 - [An Introduction to Conway's The Game of Life](https://youtu.be/ouipbDkwHWA)

Game of life rules (source: [Game of Life wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


 Optional:
 - [Inventing Game of Life (John Conway) - Numberphile](https://youtu.be/R9Plq-D1gEk)
 - [The Physics of Self-Replication](https://youtu.be/0wAYZcqSS60)
 - [Game Of Life epic examples](https://youtu.be/C2vgICfQawE?t=70)


## Exercise

Implement Conway's Game of Life displaying every step on the console!

Optional limitations:
- no if statements
- no loops
- small methods (<5 lines, 1-line?)
- no language primitives

## Retro
 - what has worked well?
 - what could be improved?

## Watch a solution: (20min)
